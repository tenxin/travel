			<h1>TIBET TOUR AND TRAVEL</h1>
			We want to give our guests a deeper, fuller understanding of Tibet through our day tours. When we design a tour, we aim to combine Tibet’s must-see sights with hidden gems that surprise even lifelong Tibetan. For example, our Bicycle Tour uses an unexpected form of Lhasa transport to introduce guests to iconic South Lhasa sights like the Potala and Tsuklagkhang as well as some lesser known places that are difficult to discover on your own such as Bhakor and lhodak <em>(santaury).</em> Our goal is to help you get closer, understand better, and experience more.
			Equally important to us is supporting the local communities where we work.With the profits from the tour and the on-going support of our guests, we have been able to provide high-quality education and extracurricular activities to over 6,000 residents of village through our NGO,<a href="http://realitygives.org/" title="have fun" >Reality Gives.</a>

			<h1>OUR STORY</h1>
			Lhasa has many sites of historic interest, including the Potala Palace, Jokhang Temple, Sera Monastery and Norbulingka. The Potala Palace, Jokhang Temple and the Norbulingka are UNESCO world heritage sites.However, many important sites were damaged or destroyed mostly, but not solely, during China's Cultural Revolution of the 1960s.Many have been restored since the 1980s.The Potala Palace, named after Mount Potala, the abode of Chenresig or Avalokitesvara,was the chief residence of the Dalai Lama. After the 14th Dalai Lama fled to India during the 1959 Tibetan uprising, the government converted the palace into a museum.

			<h3>AIRWAY</h3>

			Lhasa Gonggar Airport (IATA: LXA), built in 1965, is the aviation hub of Tibet. It is located south of the city proper. It takes around half an hour to get there by car via the Lhasa Airport Expressway.
